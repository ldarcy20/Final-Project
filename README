The most significant code to my project is in finalproject.py. This file contains my imitation zoom function, homography calculation, estimating field of view from t and corner of rectangles (in get_image_from_t), and two loops, one that
finds or loads the homography for every pair of images, and one that calculates intermediate transition images for every pair of images. I saved every frame to a directory and then used frames_to_video.py to take a series of frames and make a video.
